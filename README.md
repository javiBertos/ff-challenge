# The FinanceFox Challenge
Uses an API that operates over a single resource.

Would be great if you can implement your own API based on the specifications you can find below (*feel free to do it in python, node, ruby*). If you don't have time to do it, use the API we have already implemented.

Contains a *Backbone/Chaplin* client that consumes that API and can list, show, create, update, and remove that resource.

The app must be deployed somewhere (*heroku is the simplest option*) so we can play with it easily.

Write in plain JavaScript.

Use a CSS framework if it helps in the UI.

### Extra points:
- Creativity
- Play with lat/long fields (i.e. paint a map)
- Tests

## API USAGE DOCUMENT
